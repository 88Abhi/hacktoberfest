## Introduction
Undoubtedly, a significant portion of our childhood was dedicated to immersing ourselves in the captivating worlds of anime and manhwa. As Hacktoberfest 2023 approaches, I find myself gearing up to participate as a mentor for the very first time. To contribute to this exciting event, I've initiated the creation of a repository. This repository hosts a simple web page that allows users to both explore and contribute their beloved manhwa titles, images and description. If you possess coding skills and aspire to help make this website as impressive as <a href="https://www.asurascans.com/">Asura Scans</a>, your valuable contributions would be greatly appreciated, especially since I'm still in the learning phase.

<a href="https://www.asurascans.com/">Asura Scans</a> is a website that primarily focused on providing scanlations of various manga and manhwa titles. Here in this project i have tried to replicate that website Since distribution of manga without permission is illegal so we can't add any actual manhwa thus i have only developed the front-end part of the website ; if you are veteran at coding and open source contributions ; your help will very much be appriciated in making this website look as close to asura scans as possible.


## How Can I Contribute?
Baically you have to add your favourite manhwa as a card in this project ; i have provided the code below;
just add your code code after line number 425 and before line 426 in <a href="./index.html">index.html</a> file
